GREP(1)                                             User Commands                                             GREP(1)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  for  PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters,
       and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in  a
       shell command.

       A  FILE  of  “-”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the working
       directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       In addition, the variant programs egrep and fgrep are the same as grep -E and  grep -F,  respectively.   These
       variants are deprecated, but are provided for backward compatibility.
